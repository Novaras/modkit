45000	Retrieve the Bentusi Hyperspace Core
45001	Research Radiation Shielding and Retrieve the Bentusi Core fragments
45002	Destroy the Vaygr Forces
45020	BENTUSI RUINS
45021	MISSION FAILED
45030	Hyperspace successful. We have cleared the shock wave.
45031	Scans of the debris field have isolated three fragments of the Bentusi Hyperspace Core.
45032	The Containment Units are located here.
45033	The Core itself is here.
45034	All three elements must be retrieved.
45035	However, the destruction of Bentus has created a hazardous environment.
45036	Proceed with caution.
45037	Dispatch a Probe to analyze the core fragments.
45040	Caution.
45041	Dangerous particle emissions have been located near the Core Fragments.
45042	Research division reports that they can adjust the Defense Field Generators in order to provide protection from the hazardous emissions.
45043	Begin enhanced Defense Field Frigate research.
45045	Alert!
45046	Vaygr hyperspace signals identified.
45050	The Vaygr are using shielded carriers to navigate the area.
45055	The Vaygr have salvaged one of the core fragments.
45056	They are moving the fragment to one of their carriers.
45057	We must retrieve this fragment immediately.
45060	 A Resource Collector has been destroyed while retrieving the core fragments.
45061	The core fragment is now drifting.
45062	Assign additional Collectors to secure the core.
45065	A Bentusi core fragment has been loaded aboard a Vaygr Carrier.
45066	Disable the Carrier before it can enter Hyperspace.
45070	The Vaygr Carrier has entered hyperspace.
45071	We have lost the Bentusi Core.
45075	The first core fragment is secure.
45076	Retrieve the remaining two.
45080	Second core fragment retrieved.
45081	We only require the final component. It must be secured immediately.
45085	All three Bentusi Core fragments are safe.
45086	The First of the Great Cores now belongs to us.
45087	Dispatch the remaining Vaygr forces.
45090	All Vaygr have been defeated. No additional hostile contacts detected.
45091	We have re-established contact with Captain Soban's tracking device.
45092	The Bentusi Core is stable and has established a positive link with our own.
45093	Far jump coordinates locked in.
45200	Send a Probe to investigate the Hyperspace disturbance around the Core fragments.
45205	Research Radiation Shielding to retrieve the Bentusi Core Fragments. Defense Field Frigates will be required.
45206	Defense Field Frigates will be able to shield the Collectors as they retrieve the Core fragments once Radiation Shielding is researched.
45210	Destroy the Vaygr.
45290	Bentusi Debris
