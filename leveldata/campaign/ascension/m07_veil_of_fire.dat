43000	Build Movers to clear the radioactive debris.
43001	Use Movers to destroy the radioactive debris.
43002	Investigate the derelict hulks
43003	Destroy all remaining Vaygr Forces
43005	MISSION FAILED.
43006	PROGENITOR FOUNDRY
43007	MISSION FAILED
43010	Debris
43011	Radiation
43012	Progenitor Derelict
43013	Vaygr Probe
43014	Vaygr Production Ship
43020	Hyperspace jump interrupted.
43021	We are surrounded by Progenitor wreckage.
43026	We have exited Hyperspace in close proximity to a debris field.
43022	The Oracle confirms this wreckage was once the engineering bay of the Progenitor Ship.
43023	*** AXED *** This entire region is flooded with radioactive clouds.
43024	 Scans of the surrounding hulks have detected Quantum Wave Form irregularities. They are preventing us from initiating a Hyperspace jump.
43025	 If we are to reach the Dreadnaught, the debris must be cleared.  Send a probe to investigate the local hulks.
43030	Priority alert.
43031	A Vaygr long-range probe has been activated.
43032	It must be destroyed before it can relay our position to the enemy.
43035	The probe is transmitting data to the enemy.
43036	A Vaygr attack is now imminent.
43040	Probe destroyed.
43041	It is likely the enemy will send patrols to investigate.
43042	Prepare for possible Vaygr attacks.
43045	Alert!
43046	Hyperspace signature detected.
43047	Elite Vaygr forces are using shielded carriers to penetrate the radiation.
43049	 Alert. We are detecting dangerous levels of radiation.
43050	*** AXED *** Our ships cannot withstand this radiation.
43051	They must be destroyed to allow the Mothership to Hyperspace.
43052	These hulks appear to be the source.
43053	Progenitor Movers have been located within the cloud.
43054	They appear to be able to withstand the radiation.
43055	Research division has completed analysis of the Mover we found.  We can now replicate Mover technology.
43056	Build a Mover Construction Facility.
43057	Movers will be able to safely enter the radiation cloud and destroy the contaminated hulks.
43060	Mover Construction Facility online.
43061	Use Movers to destroy the debris.
43065	Debris destroyed.
43066	The radiation in the area is diminishing.
43070	Radioactive hulk destroyed.
43075	Radiation levels dropping. The Quantum Wave Form is returning to normal tolerance.
43076	We are now clear to enter Hyperspace.
43080	Hyperspace Core fully charged.
43081	Detecting only minor Quantum Waveform fluctuations. We are clear to jump.
43082	Initiate Hyperspace.
43090	We cannot be followed. Eradicate all remaining Vaygr forces.
43110	Hiigaran Navy
43111	Vaygr Forward Assault
43112	Progenitor debris
43113	Progenitor
43120	Radioactive debris.  Destroy it to reduce the Quantum irregularities in this area.
43121	Send a probe to  investigate the debris.
43124	Destroy the probe before it can broadcast our location.
43130	Build a Mover Production Subsystem on the Mothership. It is located in the Corvette Panel.
43131	Use Movers to destroy all seven radioactive hulks.
43135	This will reduce the Quantum Interference, allowing the Mothership to Hyperspace freely.
43132	Send a ship to investigate the debris producing the irregularities in this area.
43140	We cannot allow the Vaygr to follow us.  Destroy all remaining Vaygr forces.
43141	SAVING GAME
