56060	The Great Harbor Ship of Bentus...
56061	... the last of the Bentusi.
56062	The Time of Prophecy is at hand.
56063	In the beginning, the Great Progenitor Sajuuk forged The Three Cores to unlock the mystery of Hyperspace.
56064	But the Three became separated, and the Progenitors faded from memory.
56065	For eons, the Cores drifted apart, until the First came to the Bentusi.
56066	The Second came to your ancestors. In their blindness, they became as the Vaygr are now, and a Great War consumed them also.
56067	Before their final hour, they secreted their Core from the Emperor and carried it with them into exile.
56068	It remains in your possession.
56069	The Core Trinity must be united. The Three will awaken Sajuuk.
56070	Only the power of the Great Progenitor can defeat Makaan and the Vaygr.
56071	The Oracle will take you to the Keeper of Sajuuk.
56072	Seek it out among the asteroids of Gehenna.
56073	This is your destiny.
56074	The End Time has begun.
56075	Farewell.
