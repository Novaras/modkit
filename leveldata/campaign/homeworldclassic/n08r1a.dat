66636	It has been forbidden to possess this information for some time.  But after your intervention on our behalf, we feel compelled to share it with you.  Behold:
66637	In the First Time, a terrible war brought with it the collapse of your ancient empire.  So vicious were your enemies that all would have been slaughtered were it not for the collective outcry for mercy.
66638	In an effort to soothe relations, the conquerors spared the lives of the defeated.  All survivors were sent into exile.
66639	None were permitted to follow or aid the fallen.  All memory of them was to be erased.
66640	For generations the convoy moved silently through space.  They endured great difficulties...
66641	...imperfect technology...
66642	In time, a suitable system to receive them was found.
66643	This barren world appeared to be salvation. Their true legacy forgotten, a new vision of destiny had grown out of captivity.
66644	A single artifact survived the journey.  The Guidestone you now carry.  It was removed from the sacred "Angel Moon"  of your Homeworld, a place long since reduced to myth and tale.
66645	Your progress is becoming known among the Inner Rim worlds and elsewhere.  Many cultures have prophesized your return.
