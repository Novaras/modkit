66488	We are the Bentusi, and welcome you among space-faring cultures: The Unbound.  The Outer Limb Trade Routes were established in the First Time by our ancestors.  The resources you collect are of value to the Bentusi Exchange.  They will serve as an acceptable medium for trade.  It has been our custom to equip trading partners with an exchange unit.  It has therefore been provided to your ambassador as a gesture of good will.
