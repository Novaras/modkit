66543	Ambassador away.
66544	This is the Garden of Kadesh.  For thirteen generations, we have protected it from the unclean.
66545	The Turanic Raiders who came before you refused to join and were punished for this trespass. Like theirs, your ship has already defiled this holy place.
66546	If you have come to join, we welcome you, and will spare you your ship until all have disembarked.  If you have come to consume the garden, you will be removed at once.
66547	What are your intentions?
66548	We were unaware of the significance of this location.  We mean you no conflict.  Please allow us time to prepare our engines so that we may withdraw as requested.
66549	If you will not join, then die.  There is no withdrawal from the Garden.
