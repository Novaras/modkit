60429	No one's left... Everything's gone...!  Kharak is burning!
60430	Kharak is being consumed by a firestorm.  The Scaffold has been destroyed.  All orbital facilities destroyed.  Significant debris ring in low Kharak orbit.  Receiving no communications from anywhere in the system... Not even beacons.
60431	Wait!  On the maintenance frequency.  I'm getting a signal from the Cryo Tray systems in orbit.  One of them is suffering a massive malfunction.
60432	Dispatch Salvage Corvettes immediately to collect the trays.
60433	These ships are different from those we encountered at the Khar-Selim.  It is likely they were involved in the destruction of Kharak.
60434	Capture at least one vessel for interrogation and destroy the rest.
60435	Those trays contain all that remain of our people.  Without them, we will become extinct.
60436	Hostile vessel captured.  Crew interned.  Interrogation is underway.  While searching the enemy ship's computer systems, we came across these flight recordings.  Stand by for playback.
60462	Analysis of the recording indicates that the Kharak missile defenses heavily damaged the attacking fleet.  However, we have concluded that at present they can still easily defeat us.  We have therefore plotted a course to a deep space asteroid belt.  There we can hide and prepare our fleet for an assault.
60463	Our research division has analyzed the captured frigate.  We have reverse engineered the drive technology and developed two new ships.  Plans for a third vessel are underway, but will require Frigate Chassis research.
60464	Cryo tray loaded.  One hundred thousand people secured.
60465	Cryo tray loaded.  Two hundred thousand people secured.
60466	Cryo tray loaded.  Three hundred thousand people secured.
60467	Cryo tray loaded.  Four hundred thousand people secured.
60468	Cryo tray loaded.  Five hundred thousand people secured.
60469	Withdraw attack and deploy a Salvage Team.  We need that ship.
60470	Cryo trays loaded and secure.  Hyperspace module charged.  There's nothing left for us here.  Let's go.
60471	Unidentified Hostiles
60472	Taiidan Empire
60759	The Cryo Trays are under attack.  Defend them.
60760	Enemy units neutralized.  Begin salvaging the cryo trays.
60814	The enemy is attempting to destroy our colonist cryo trays!  Defend our people at all costs!
60815	We must learn the nature of this new threat.  Use Salvage Corvettes to bring in an enemy ship intact for interrogation.
60473	The cryo trays are exposed.  Use Salvage Corvettes to load the trays into the Mothership immediately.
