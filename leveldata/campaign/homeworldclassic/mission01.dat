60376	Fleet Intelligence going online.  Our task is to analyze all sensor data and generate mission objectives.  Before the hyperdrive test, several trials must be completed.
60377	Test construction by building the primary research ship.
60378	Test resource processing by harvesting the asteroids provided nearby.
60379	Stand by to begin combat trials.  First, we will be monitoring formation performance.
60380	Target Drones have been provided here.  Assign a formation to your Fighters and destroy the Drones.
60381	Target Drones destroyed.  Replacement Drones are being sent to the same location.  Completion of this trial requires the use of a formation.  Begin again.
60382	Formation trial complete.  Flight analysis shows a twenty-two percent increase in combat performance.
60383	The next trial will test the effectiveness of tactics.  Stand by to begin tactics trial.  Use Aggressive or Evasive tactics, and engage the Target Drones here.
60384	Target Drones destroyed.  Replacement Drones are being sent to the same location.  Completion of this trial requires the use of tactics.  Begin again.
60385	Tactics trial complete.
60386	The next trial will test the performance of the Salvage Corvette.  Build one and capture the Target Drone here.
60387	Target Drone destroyed.  A replacement Drone is being sent to the same location.  Completion of this trial requires a successful capture of the drone.  Begin again.
60388	Interceptors are ready for construction.
60389	Advanced Target Drones with heavier armor have been provided.  Using Interceptors, begin the mock combat exercise here.
60390	Target Drones destroyed.  Replacement Drones are being sent to the same location.  Completion of this trial requires the use of Interceptors.  Begin again.
60391	Hyperspace module charging.  35% capacity and rising.  The Mothership will be ready for the Hyperdrive test in 10 minutes.
60392	Stand by for Hyperdrive test.  Internal pressure doors will be sealed in 2 minutes.  Abort systems standing by.
60393	Hyperspace module fully charged.  I am ready to initiate quantum wave generation on your mark.  Good luck, everyone.
60394	All sections have reported in.  We are clear to proceed.  Trigger the hyperspace drive at your discretion.
60395	Combat Training
60734	The primary Research Ship has been constructed and the Research Division is online.  Begin Fighter Chassis research immediately.
60800	We must test the Mothership's resource processing capability.  Collect useable hard materials from the remaining asteroids in Kharak's orbit.
60801	Propulsion and weapons research is too hazardous to conduct within the Mothership.  Construct a research vessel to safely house these experiments.
60802	Though unlikely, we must prepare for the possibility of encountering hostile alien craft.  We should finalize our plans for a proper zero-g fighter.
60803	We need to test Fleet Command's command and control interface.  Assign strikecraft a formation and send them to destroy the assigned drones.
60804	We must drill our pilots' handling of tactical adaptibility.  Assign them a new tactic and destroy the remaining drones.
60805	It is time to test the hard asset retrieval process of the Salvage Corvette.  Capture the drone and return it to the Mothership for processing.
60806	We must test the combat effectiveness of our new fighter class, the Interceptor.  Use Interceptors to destroy the advanced combat drones.
60396	Formation Trial Target Drones
60397	Tactics Trial Target Drones
60398	Interceptor Trial
60399	Salvage Trial Target Drone
