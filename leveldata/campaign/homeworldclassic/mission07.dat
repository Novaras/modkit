60540	The nebula is incredibly rich in energy and resources.  Energy levels are so high that our sensors are having trouble compensating.  Begin harvesting the nebula while we recalibrate the sensors.
60541	There is a contact closing with the Mothership.  Sensor instability in this region makes it difficult to identify.
60542	Prepare the Ambassador.
60550	Delay the attacking ships while Fleet Command charges the hyperdrive module.  We should have the range to jump clear of the nebula.
60551	Hyperspace module at 35%, ready in 8 minutes.
60552	Hyperspace module at 90%, ready in 1 minute.
60553	Hyperspace module fully charged.
60554	Coordinates set.  Engage hyperdrive!
60555	Hyperdrive jump failed!  The Quantum waveform collapsed before the fleet could enter hyperspace.
60556	Analyzing malfunction.  Continue to protect the Mothership until the problem is solved.
60557	Enemy forces are concentrating on our Resource Collectors.  Allocate combat vessels to protect them.
60558	The Hyperdrive is back on-line.
60559	Let's put these fanatics behind us.

60767	Analyzing field.  Continue to protect the Mothership until the source is located.
60768	The inhibitor field has disappeared.
60769	The Hyperdrive is fully functional.
60770	The enemy is relying heavily on Fighter-class ships.  Our Research division reports it can design a new type of Corvette specially suited to combat multiple fighters.  Begin research as soon as possible.
60788	Hyperspace module charging, ready in eight minutes.
60789	Hyperspace module charging, ready in one minute.
60790	Hyperdrive jump failed!  The quantum waveform collapsed due to some kind of inhibitor field.
60825	We are currently charging the Hyperspace Core to clear the nebula.  Protect the Mothership until the Hyperspace Core is fully charged.
60826	We have jumped into a nebula dense with useable energy and materials.  Send Resource Collectors to capitalize on this valuable opportunity.
60827	The enemy is attempting to destroy our Resource Collectors.  Send escort fleets to protect them from these fanatics.
60531	Research Division reports it is now equipped for Super Capital Ship Drive technology.  We advise commencing research immediately.
60543	Unkown Contact
60544	Anomaly
