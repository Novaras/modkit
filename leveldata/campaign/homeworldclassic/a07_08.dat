65560	The enemy Mothership appeared to be equipped with a powerful field generator.
65561	This field deformed our quantum wavefront and prevented us from making a hyperspace jump.
65562	We also observed that the enemy's hyperspace module has an identical power signature to our own.
65563	This raises interesting questions considering our own technology was reverse-engineered from the wreck of the Khar-Toba.
65564	Our hyperspace systems are now functioning properly and this jump will carry us clear of the Nebula.
