60614	Hyperspace jump successful.  We have cleared the Outer Rim dust bank.
60615	The supernova is two hundred and fifteen light years away.  It is emitting intense radiation.
60616	Strike Craft are especially vulnerable to this radiation.  Capital ships will be the most effective due to their heavy armor.
60617	The Research Station is located here.  Assemble a heavy strike force and destroy it.
60618	Radiation is much heavier than we expected.  Sensors indicate that asteroids may have shielding properties.
60619	We recommend using the asteroid pockets for protection.
60620	The radiation is disrupting our normal resource collecting operations.  Deploy a Resource Controller in the shielded asteroid pockets.
60621	Research Division reports it is now equipped for Proximity Sensor technology.  We advise commencing research immediately.
60622	The enemy is using mines.  Research Division reports it can produce a Corvette-class minelaying ship.  We advise commencing research immediately.
60623	We must destroy the garrison protecting the station.  Enemy units cannot be allowed to escape or they may alert the Empire to our presence.
60624	We are picking up a quantum wave effect.  A Taiidan Carrier is loading ships and powering up.  It must be destroyed before it can hyperspace.
60625	We are picking up a quantum wave effect.  A Kushan Carrier is loading ships and powering up.  It must be destroyed before it can hyperspace.
60626	Enemy base and fleet destroyed.  Hyperspace drives online.
60627	Taiidan Empire
60781	Radiation is much heavier than we expected.  Sensors indicate that these veins of space dust may have shielding properties. We recommend using the veins for protection.
60833	We are in range of our target.  The loss of the research station will be a major blow to the Taiidan Empire.  Destroy it.
60834	The station is heavily guarded by a Taiidan garrison.  Destroy them.  Do not let any ships warn the Taiidan of our presence.
60835	The Taiidan carrier is attempting to hyperspace out of the system.  We can not allow this.  Destroy the carrier before it escapes.
60628	Research Station
60629	Escaping Carrier
