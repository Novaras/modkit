65333	Deep inside the ruin was a single stone that would change the course of our history forever.
65334	On the stone was etched a galactic map ...
65335	and a single word more ancient than the clans themselves ...
65336	Hiigara.
65337	Our home.
65338	The clans were united, and a massive colony ship was designed.

65342	She is now Fleet Command.
65343	The promise of the Guidestone united the entire population.
