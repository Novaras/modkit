60566	It's a trap!
60567	Sensors detect hyperspace inhibitors in a triangular formation.  Even one can keep us from entering hyperspace.  All of them must be destroyed.
60568	The nebula is still scrambling our sensors but it looks like we have incoming enemy units.
60569	Research Division reports it is now equipped for Drone technology.  We advise commencing research immediately.

60571	Again we offer you the chance to join us and live here in peace.
60572	Our future lies elsewhere, but we already have something in common.  The hyperdrive technology we use is identical to yours.  Our ancestors left it in a wreckage on our planet.  We're on a mission to find our Homeworld.
60573	You will fail.  The evil that drove us here will find and destroy you.  From you they will know of us and come here.  This cannot come to pass.
60574	We have enemy units closing on multiple attack vectors.  Engage and destroy hostiles.
60575	Enemy vessels retreating to this point.  This reading has been consistent despite sensor interference.  It has a friendly signature but it's not one of ours.
60576	It looks just like the Khar-Toba.

60773	It's the Khar-Toba.
60774	Metallurgy and structural composition of the ship are an identical match to the Khar-Toba wreckage on Kharak.  Our origins are the same.
60791	We cannot stay - we're on a journey.  But let there be peace between us, for we have something in common.  The hyperdrive technology left to us by our ancestors is identical to yours.  The Homeworld we seek may be yours as well.
60828	The Kadeshi have deployed hyperspace inhibitors to prevent our escape.  Destroy all inhibitors to allow us to engage the Hyperspace Core.
60829	The Kadeshi ambush has the Mothership surrounded.  Engage and destroy all hostiles.  Protect the Mothership at all costs.
